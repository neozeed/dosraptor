# DOS Raptor
![raptor](https://github.com/neozeed/dosraptor/assets/9031439/c089b68d-8396-41f7-b831-981a400c68b5)

This is the original Raptor Call Of The Shadows DOS source code v1.2 with the Apogee Sound System and the
DMX wrapper APODMX instead of the proprietary DMX library.

## Build
To build all libraries and the exe under DOS use Watcom C 10.0 and TASM 3.1.
For a build that more closely matches the original exe file v1.2 (without DMX library) you will need the following:
```
AUDIOLIB: Watcom C 10.0 and TASM 3.1
APODMX: A compatible version of Watcom C32 
GFX: Watcom C 9.5b and TASM 3.1
SOURCE: Watcom C 10.0 and TASM 3.1
```
